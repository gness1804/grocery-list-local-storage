##Idea Box Re-Created

This is a re-creation of my [Idea Box project](https://github.com/adam-rice/IdeaBox) from a few weeks ago. It employs bare-bones CSS and establishes most of the core functionality from the original project, using different and more effective JavaScript (such as forEach as opposed to the original for loops) when possible. I am undertaking this project in order to strengthen my understanding of JSON and local storage as well as object-oriented programming.

See the [original project repo](https://github.com/adam-rice/IdeaBox) for the original project specs and other details.
