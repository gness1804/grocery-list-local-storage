##Grocery List with Local storage

[Try it out!](https://gness1804.github.io/grocery-list-local-storage/)

This is a grocery list app modeled on [Idea Box](https://github.com/gness1804/IdeaBox). It allows the user to add items to the "cart" and stores them in local storage so that the item data are saved upon reload. The current attributes permitted per item are name, aisle, id (automatically generated to keep track of each item), quantity, and a note. More features coming soon.
